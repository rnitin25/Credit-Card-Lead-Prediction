                                                                        Credit Card Lead Prediction Report

train : the given data is further divided into train and test where model is built on 80% of the data and remaining was left to test the model
test : the given test data is saved as 'new_customer' data to avoid confusion during model building stage


1. Data Preparation :
	To prepare data for model building, I  have performed following tramsformation thorugh pipeline

	a) Numerical Dataset Pipeline :   
	
 	> Avg Account balance is tranformed into its log to normalize its distribution
	> There are some outliers present , hence capped the outliers value with respective 99th & 1st percentile value.
	> All the features are scaled by Standard Scalar

	b) Categorical Dataset Pipeline
	> There are missing values in Credit_Product column , which is replaced by its most frequent value
	> All the features get one-hot-encoded

2. Model Building :
	
	train data is divided into X_train , and y_train
	test data is divided into X_test and y_test


	a) Model accuracy was tested on various algorithms and Gradient Boost was consider giving best cross-val-score  of 78% but poor result on test data ,
	    hence sign of overfitting

3. To overcome the overfitting:
	Undersampling :  As only approx 24% true value was available for target variable , thus the worst model could give accuracy of 76% , to overcome this issue
		            I have undersampled the data to get 50-50 ratio of target labels with 'imblearn package'
	The model parameters was tuned with Gridsearch and best model was selected which gave better result on both train and test data.

4. The model then used to predict probabilities of new data.
